# Extended Kalman Filter

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Follow the taugh Extended Kalman Filter algorithm to build a C++ based project
* Test the created Extended Kalman Filter with simulated Lidar and Radar dataset.
* The position & verlosity vector output coordinates [px, py, vx, vy ] must have an root-mean-square error, RMSE <= [.11, .11, 0.52, 0.52] 



## Algorithm Flow

### 1. Initialize the state and covariance matrices.

### 2. Predict the state.

### 3. Update the state and covariance matrices.



## Simulation

### 1. Files.

### 2. Build the project

### 3. Connect the simulator.
