# Extended Kalman Filter

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Follow the taugh Extended Kalman Filter algorithm to build a C++ based project
* Test the created Extended Kalman Filter with simulated Lidar and Radar dataset.
* The position & verlosity vector output coordinates [px, py, vx, vy ] must have an root-mean-square error, RMSE <= [.11, .11, 0.52, 0.52]

### 1. Initialize the state and covariance matrices.

        x - Initial measurement
        F - State transition model
        P - Error covariance matrix (a measure of the estimated accuracy of the state estimate)
        H - Observation model
        Q - Covariance of the process noise

### 2. Predict the state.

        x' = F * x + u  -  Predicted (a priori) state estimate 
        P = F * P * F^T + Q  -  Predicted (a priori) error covariance

### 3. Update the state and covariance matrices.

        y = z − H * x'  -  Measurement pre-fit residual 
        S = H * P' * H^T + R  -  Pre-fit residual covariance 
        K = P' * H * S^-1  -  Kalman gain 
        x = x' + K * y  -  Updated state estimate 
        P = (I − K * H) * P'  -  Updated estimate covariance 

### 4. Extended Kalman Filter

Extended Kalman Filter essentially linearizes the non-linear function around the current estimate. A matrix of partial derivatives (the Jacobian) is computed:

which is used for updating process :

        y = z − H * x'  -  Measurement pre-fit residual
