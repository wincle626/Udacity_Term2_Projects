## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Background

One of the basic implementation of a control system is a Proportional (P), Differential (D), Integral (I), together, a PID controller. PID controller is the most popular controller and is used in applications across domains. 

The basic principle of working of a PID controller is to satisfy a boundary value problem. Most common examples of such problems are either minimization of the total error in the system or maximization of the total gain in the system. These error or gain problems are represented mathematically and are used to govern the effect to P, I and D components of a PID controller. These components are described below:

  1. Proportional (P) component:
    Mathematically, the P component establishes linear relationship with the problem. The effect of P component is in proportional to the value of problem at the current time step. For e.g.:, if the problem is to minimize the error in the system at current time step, the value of P component is given by the formula:
    
    αp = -Kp * error
    
    where, Kp is a tuning parameter known as the proportional gain. The negative sign in the beginning signifies that P component is used to cancel the effect or error, or in other words, reduce it.
    
  2. Differential (D) component:
    Mathematically, the D component establishes linear relationship with the rate of change of problem. The effect of D component is in proportional to the rate of change problem from last time step to current time step. For e.g.:, if the problem is to minimize the uncertainty in the system, the value of D component is given by the formula:
    
    αd = -Kd * d(error)/dt
    
    where, Kd is a tuning parameter known as the differential gain. The negative sign in the beginning signifies that D component is used to cancel the effect or rate of change of error, or in other words, reduce it. The D component is used to minimize sudden changes in the system.
    
  3. Integral (D) component:
    Mathematically, the I component establishes linear relationship between the average value of problem over time. The effect of I component is in proportional to the average value of problem from the beginning of time to the current time step. For e.g., if the problem is to minimize the error in the system, the value of I component is given by the formula:
    
    αi = -Ki * ∑ error
    
    where, Ki is a tuning parameter known as the integral gain. The negative sign in the beginning signifies that I component is used to cancel the effect or average error, or in other words, reduce it. The I component is used to correct systemic bias.
    
  When all components are used, the mathematical equation is given by:
  
  α = (-Kp * error) + (-Kd * d(error)/dt) + (Ki * ∑ error)
  
  where, α is the control input to the system, often known as the **actuator** input.

## Project Implementation

The final implementation consisted of following major steps:

  1. PID coefficient initialation: it is to set the initial values of coefficient Kp, Ki, Kd as starting point for PID controller. Here the initial values is significantly effect on the contoller output even with the coefficient tuing process. Here, I used the Ziegler-Nichols method: a.Set all gains to 0; b. Set Kd; c. Set Kp to about 1% of Kd and slightly increase Kp; d. Set Ki to about 1% of Kp. 

  2. PID error update: the values for each error component is updated by using the recorded cross track error (cte) from the simulator: a. p_error = cte; b. i_error += cte; c. d_error = cte - previous_cte. 

  3. PID error control output: it is the output given by α = (-Kp * error) + (-Kd * d(error)/dt) + (Ki * ∑ error). 

  4. PID coefficient tuning: it uses the [Gradient Descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) or the twiddle algorithm for PID controller. The algorithm follows the Python implementation:
	
	p = [0, 0, 0] # Choose an initialization parameter vector
	
	dp = [1, 1, 1] # Define potential changes	

	best_err = A(p)# Calculate the error

	threshold = 0.001

	for i in range(len(p)):

		p[i] += dp[i]

		err = A(p)

		if err < best_err:  # There was some improvement

		    best_err = err

		    dp[i] *= 1.1

		else:  # There was no improvement

		    p[i] -= 2*dp[i]  # Go into the other direction

  		    err = A(p)

		    if err < best_err:  # There was an improvement

		        best_err = err

		        dp[i] *= 1.05

		    else  # There was no improvement

		        p[i] += dp[i]

		        dp[i] *= 0.95 # As there was no improvement, the step size in either direction, the step si

## Project Output

PID controller used to derive the steering angles for a car moving on a circular track was implemented successfully. The car could stay close to the center of the lane and take smooth left and right turns along its path. The result of using Ziegler-Nichols method only and Ziegler-Nichols method with twiddle are compared. Results are in folder video_output. 

Although the results show that the car follows the trojectory, the PID coefficient tuning is still a pain for both initiation and twiddle. Especially, the initiation does affect on the result a lot even with the twiddle algorithm. It worth a further check about how to set and tune PID coefficients.
